# Graceful Handling of Unified/Simple Links

This document explains how the ULink SDK handles two distinct types of links and provides graceful in-app handling for simple redirect links.

## Link Types

The ULink SDK supports two types of links:

### 1. Dynamic Links
- **Purpose**: Designed for app deep linking with parameters, fallback URLs, and smart app store redirects
- **Intended for**: In-app handling with custom parameters and logic
- **Type**: Automatically determined as `dynamic` by server
- **Type**: `ULinkType.dynamic`

### 2. Unified/Simple Links
- **Purpose**: Simple platform-based redirects (iOS URL, Android URL, fallback URL)
- **Intended for**: Browser-based platform detection and redirection
- **Type**: Determined from server response `type` field
- **Type**: `ULinkType.unified`

## The Problem

When a user clicks a unified/simple link on mobile, it may open your app instead of the browser due to universal links/app links configuration. However, these simple links weren't designed for in-app handling - they're meant for browser-based platform detection and redirection.

## The Solution

### Graceful In-App Handling

When your app receives a simple redirect link, the SDK automatically:

1. **Detects the link type** based on the server response `type` field
2. **Emits the link data** on the `onUnifiedLink` stream for your app to decide next steps
3. You can optionally **open externally** using the appropriate platform-specific URL:
   - iOS: Use `iosFallbackUrl` if available
   - Android: Use `androidFallbackUrl` if available
   - Fallback: Use `fallbackUrl` for other platforms
4. **Maintains tracking** by adding the link data to the dedicated unified link stream

### Clear Link Type Distinction

The SDK automatically distinguishes between link types:

- **Dynamic links** have `type: 'dynamic'` in server response and are handled in-app
- **Simple links** have `type: 'unified'` in server response and are delivered to `onUnifiedLink`; your app decides whether to open externally
- **Unknown links** are treated as non-ULink and passed through unchanged

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Dynamic Link (In-App Handling)

```dart
final response = await ULink.instance.createLink(
  ULinkParameters.dynamic(
    slug: 'my-dynamic-link',
    iosFallbackUrl: 'https://apps.apple.com/app/myapp',
    androidFallbackUrl: 'https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.myapp',
    fallbackUrl: 'https://example.com/profile',
    parameters: {
      'screen': 'profile',
      'userId': '12345',
      'utm_source': 'app',
    },
  ),
);
```

### Creating a Unified Link (External Redirect)

```dart
final response = await ULink.instance.createLink(
  ULinkParameters.unified(
    slug: 'my-unified-link',
    iosUrl: 'https://apps.apple.com/app/my-app/id123456789',
    androidUrl: 'https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.example.myapp',
    fallbackUrl: 'https://myapp.com/product/123',
    parameters: {
      'utm_source': 'email',
      'campaign': 'summer',
    },
    metadata: {
      'custom_param': 'value',
    },
  ),
);
```

## Field Usage by Link Type

### Dynamic Links
- Use `iosFallbackUrl`, `androidFallbackUrl`, `fallbackUrl` for when app is not installed
- Include `parameters` for in-app navigation and tracking

### Unified Links
- Use `iosUrl`, `androidUrl` for direct platform-specific redirects
- Use `fallbackUrl` for other platforms or web browsers
- Include `parameters` for tracking and `metadata` for additional data

## Technical Implementation

The SDK's universal link handler works as follows:

```dart
// Listen for dynamic links (in-app handling)
ULink.instance.onLink.listen((linkData) {
  // Handle dynamic links with parameters
  print('Dynamic link received: ${linkData.rawData}');
  print('Parameters: ${linkData.parameters}');
  // Navigate to specific screens based on parameters
});

// Listen for unified links (no automatic external redirect)
ULink.instance.onUnifiedLink.listen((linkData) async {
  print('Unified link received: ${linkData.rawData}');
  // Optionally open externally
  // final url = linkData.iosFallbackUrl ?? linkData.androidFallbackUrl ?? linkData.fallbackUrl;
  // if (url != null && await canLaunchUrl(Uri.parse(url))) {
  //   await launchUrl(Uri.parse(url), mode: LaunchMode.externalApplication);
  // }
});
```

## Separate Streams for Clear Handling

The SDK provides two separate streams to avoid confusion:

- **`onLink` stream**: Only receives dynamic links intended for in-app handling
- **`onUnifiedLink` stream**: Only receives unified/simple links. Decide in your app whether to open externally

This separation ensures developers don't accidentally handle unified links as if they were dynamic links, preventing confusion and improving code clarity.

## Key Benefits

1. **Maintains Original Behavior**: Simple links can still lead to browser-based destinations when your app chooses to open externally
2. **Seamless User Experience**: Apps can choose whether to open externally or handle in-app, avoiding redirect loops
3. **Clear Distinction**: Developers can clearly distinguish between app-intended and browser-intended links through separate streams
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing dynamic links continue to work as expected
5. **Flexible Tracking**: All link interactions are tracked through appropriate streams
6. **No Developer Confusion**: Separate streams prevent accidental mishandling of link types

## Best Practices

1. **Use Dynamic Links** for deep linking, app store redirects, and in-app navigation
2. **Use Unified Links** for simple platform-based redirects and marketing campaigns
3. **Server determines link type** automatically based on configuration
4. **Provide platform-specific URLs** for better user experience
5. **Test both link types** to ensure proper behavior in your app

## Migration Guide

Existing links will continue to work as before. To take advantage of the new graceful handling:

1. **For new simple redirect links**: Server will return `type: 'unified'`
2. **For existing dynamic links**: No changes needed (server returns `type: 'dynamic'`)
3. **Update your link handling logic** to check `linkData.linkType` if needed

This approach ensures that simple links maintain their original behavior even when accidentally opened in-app, providing a smooth user experience regardless of how the link is accessed.
